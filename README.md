# Ultrasonic-radar-project
Project on embedded systems using Arduino uno microcontroller

Implementation of an obstacle detector using:

-Arduino microcontroller
-Ultrasonic sensor (Hc-SR04) for the detction of the obstacles using sound waves
-Servo motor used to rotate the sensor between 0 - 180 degrees
-LEDs used for indication of obstacle; Amber(no obstacle) and Red (obstacle)
-Processing software was used in the development of the radar
